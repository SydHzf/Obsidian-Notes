# Inheritance:
- With inheritance, a derived class inherits the already existing class's features (base class)
- Inheritance refers to using the structure and behavior of a parent class in a subclass
- Inheritance is applied to classes
- Inheritance can be of single, hybrid,multiple, hierarchical, multipath, and multilevel types.
```mermaid
graph TD
	subgraph single
	end
	A --> B
```
```mermaid

graph LR
	subgraph Hybrid
	end
    A --> B
    A --> C
    D --> A
```
```mermaid
%% Multiple Inheritance
graph TD
	subgraph multiple
	end
	A --> B
    A --> C
```
```mermaid
%% Hierarchical Inheritance
graph TD
	subgraph Hierarchical
	end
    B --> A
    C --> A
```

```mermaid
%% Multipath Inheritance
graph TD
    subgraph Multipath
	end
    A --> B
    B --> C
    A --> D
```
```mermaid
%% Multilevel Inheritance
graph TD
    subgraph Multilevel
	end
	A --> B
    B --> C
    C --> D

```
- Inheritance supports code reusability and reduces lines of code

# Polymorphism:
- Polymorphism allows class methods to exist in multiple forms
- Polymorphism intends on changing the behavior of parent classâ€™s method
- Polymorphism is applied to methods 
- Polymorphism has two types: [[compile time]] and [[run time]] polymorphism decides which form of the function to be invoked.
