Dataset is Scala only!
DataFrame VS SparkSQL:
     DataFrame is more suited for pipelines that are more hardened and less
     likely to experience change
     SparkSQL is better for pipelines that are used in collaboration with data
scientists
     Dataset is best for pipelines that require unit and integration tests.
