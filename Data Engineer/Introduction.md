- My journey into the field of data began in 2021 when I embarked on a career as a data scientist, primarily focusing on data preprocessing tasks.
- However, despite my efforts, I found it challenging to acquire real-world experience in Karachi, given the high demand for experienced professionals in this field.
- I attempted to pivot towards data analysis but discovered a stronger inclination towards coding aspects during technical interviews, particularly in roles related to data engineering.
- As a result, I now find myself transitioning into the role of a data engineer, eager to delve deeper into coding and data-related challenges.
