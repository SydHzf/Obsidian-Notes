After completing my 10 days, here is my guidance for the new learners 1. first things first, download the handout from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1byHywyGWnFo20stll1RpEn037VMJAlzG?usp=sharing or https://bayyinahtv.com/dream-big, print it out, and practice manually. It will be worth it. 2. ism seems to be the hardest, as it is the beginning of your wonderful journey. You can take as much time as you want, nothing changes. Other than that everything is just a piece of cake 3. i started this course 10 months ago, but due to worldly busyness, I was not able to proceed. After that, starting from all over, i completed this course in 25 days (approx 1 hr/day). You can make it according to your own pace, but make it on a daily basis 4. Make a habit of reading the Quran and try to find the things in it that you have just learned 5. You are doing it to understand the words of Allah. Once you have forgotten this point, nothing will work
