In Spark, different join strategies are used depending on the size and layout of the datasets being joined. Here’s a simplified explanation of the join strategies you mentioned:

### **1. Shuffle Sort-Merge Join (When Both Datasets are Large)**
- **How it works**:  
    When both datasets are large, Spark uses a **shuffle sort-merge join**. Here's what happens:
    1. Spark **shuffles** the data so that rows with the same key end up on the same executor (a process known as repartitioning).
    2. Each partition is **sorted** by the join key.
    3. Spark **merges** the two datasets by matching rows with the same key.
- **Why it's used**:  
    It's efficient for large datasets because it avoids keeping all data in memory, but the **shuffling** step can be expensive and time-consuming.
    
- **Key points**:
    
    - Needs large memory for sorting.
    - High shuffle cost.
    - Suitable when both datasets are too large to fit in memory.

### **2. Broadcast Hash Join (When One Dataset is Small)**

- **How it works**:  
    If one dataset is small enough to fit in memory, Spark uses a **broadcast hash join**:
    1. The small dataset is **broadcast** (copied) to all executors.
    2. Each executor loads the small dataset into memory and performs a **hash join** with the partitions of the larger dataset.
- **Why it's used**:  
    It avoids shuffling the large dataset, making it very fast.
- **Key points**:
    - The smaller dataset must fit into memory.
    - Very efficient for skewed data or when one dataset is much smaller.
    - Spark decides whether to use this automatically if the `spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold` is set appropriately.

### **3. Bucket Join (Avoids Shuffle for Pre-Bucketed Data)**

- **How it works**:  
    If both datasets are **bucketed** on the same column (split into pre-defined buckets based on the join key):
    1. Spark doesn’t need to shuffle the data.
    2. Instead, it directly matches data from the corresponding buckets in each dataset.
- **Why it's used**:  
    It saves a lot of time by avoiding the shuffle stage, which is expensive for large datasets.
- **Key points**:
    - Both datasets must be pre-bucketed on the same column with the same number of buckets.
    - Ideal for repeated joins on the same key.
    - Ensures efficient processing for very large datasets.

### **Comparison of Strategies**

|**Join Type**|**Best for**|**Avoids Shuffle?**|**Memory Requirement**|
|---|---|---|---|
|Shuffle Sort-Merge Join|Large datasets on both sides|No|Moderate|
|Broadcast Hash Join|One large dataset, one small dataset|Yes|Small dataset in memory|
|Bucket Join|Large datasets with pre-bucketed data|Yes|Pre-bucketed setup|
