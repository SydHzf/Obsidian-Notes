A z-score, also known as a standard score, measures the number of standard deviations a data point is from the mean of a data set. It is a way to standardize data points from different distributions, allowing comparison across different scales.

### Formula for Z-Score

\[ Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} \]

Where:
- \( Z \) is the z-score.
- \( X \) is the value of the data point.
- \( \mu \) is the mean of the data set.
- \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation of the data set.

### Interpretation of Z-Score

- **Z = 0**: The data point is exactly at the mean.
- **Z > 0**: The data point is above the mean.
- **Z < 0**: The data point is below the mean.
- **Z = 1**: The data point is one standard deviation above the mean.
- **Z = -1**: The data point is one standard deviation below the mean.

### Applications and Benefits

1. **Standardization**:
   - Z-scores standardize data, making it easier to compare data points from different distributions or scales. This is particularly useful in data engineering when dealing with diverse datasets.

2. **Outlier Detection**:
   - Z-scores help identify outliers. Data points with z-scores greater than +3 or less than -3 are typically considered outliers, indicating they are unusually high or low compared to the rest of the data.

3. **Normalization**:
   - In machine learning, z-scores can normalize features, ensuring that they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This improves the performance and convergence rate of many algorithms.

4. **Hypothesis Testing**:
   - Z-scores are used in hypothesis testing to determine if a sample mean significantly differs from a population mean. They help calculate p-values to make decisions about the null hypothesis.

5. **Probability Calculations**:
   - Z-scores allow for the calculation of probabilities and percentiles in a normal distribution, enabling predictions and inferences about data.

### Example Scenario

Suppose you are analyzing the performance of servers in a data center. The response times (in milliseconds) for a sample of servers are as follows:

\[20, 22, 25, 30, 28, 24, 35, 40] 

First, calculate the mean and standard deviation of the response times:

- Mean (\(\mu\)) = 28 ms
- Standard deviation (\(\sigma\)) = 7 ms

Now, calculate the z-score for a server with a response time of 35 ms:

\[ Z = \frac{35 - 28}{7} = 1 \]

The z-score of 1 indicates that the server's response time is one standard deviation above the mean. If you encounter a server with a z-score of 3, you may consider it an outlier and investigate potential issues causing the unusually high response time.

### Conclusion

Z-scores are a powerful statistical tool in data engineering for standardizing data, detecting outliers, normalizing features, conducting hypothesis tests, and calculating probabilities. They provide a consistent way to interpret and compare data points across different datasets and distributions.
