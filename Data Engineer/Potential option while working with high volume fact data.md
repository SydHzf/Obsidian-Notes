### **1. Sampling**

Sampling involves working with a **subset of the data** instead of processing the entire dataset. This approach is used when **imprecision** is acceptable and performance gains are necessary.

#### **When Sampling Works Best**:

- **Metric-driven use cases**: Aggregating metrics like averages, sums, or percentages.
    - Example: Estimating average sales per region without needing exact results.
- **Large datasets**: When the data is too large to process efficiently in real time.

#### **Advantages of Sampling**:

- Reduces computation time.
- Lowers resource usage (CPU, memory, storage).

#### **Challenges**:

- Not suitable for all use cases. Sampling may lead to inaccuracies, especially for:
    - Rare events or outliers.
    - Use cases requiring exact counts or relationships (e.g., joining datasets).

#### **Example**:

```sql

SELECT AVG(sales)  FROM sales_table  TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM (10); 
-- Use a 10% random sample of the data`
```

### **2. Bucketing**

Bucketing divides the fact data into **fixed buckets** based on a specific column (usually one of the dimensions, like `user_id`). This organization helps optimize performance during joins and queries.

#### **How Bucketing Works**:

- Data is **hashed** by the column youâ€™re bucketing on (e.g., `user_id`) and divided into a fixed number of buckets.
- Each bucket is stored in a separate file or partition.

#### **Advantages of Bucketing**:

1. **Improves join performance**:
    - Joins on bucketed columns avoid expensive **shuffle operations**.
    - Example: Bucketing `user_id` in both datasets allows the join to directly match buckets without redistributing data.
2. **SMB Joins (Sorted-Merge Bucket Joins)**:
    - With bucketed and sorted data, the database can perform joins without any shuffling or reordering.
    - Significantly faster for large datasets.

#### **Challenges**:

- Requires upfront planning: You need to decide the bucket column and the number of buckets.
- Bucket structure is static: Changing the number of buckets later is difficult.
- Best suited for datasets with evenly distributed values in the bucket column.

#### **Example of Bucketing** (in Hive or Spark):


```sql
CREATE TABLE fact_sales (     user_id INT,     product_id INT,     sales_amount DECIMAL ) CLUSTERED BY (user_id) INTO 10 BUCKETS STORED AS ORC;`
```
#### **Example of SMB Join**:


```sql

SET hive.optimize.bucketmapjoin = true; SET hive.optimize.bucketmapjoin.sortedmerge = true;  SELECT a.user_id, a.sales_amount, b.user_name FROM fact_sales a JOIN user_details b ON a.user_id = b.user_id;`
```

### **Comparison Between Sampling and Bucketing**

|Aspect|Sampling|Bucketing|
|---|---|---|
|**Purpose**|Reduce data volume for faster analysis|Organize data to optimize joins|
|**Precision**|Imprecise (approximate results)|Precise (no data loss)|
|**Use Case**|Metric-driven analysis|Large-scale joins|
|**Performance**|Faster due to smaller data processing|Faster due to reduced shuffling|
|**Setup**|No upfront design required|Requires planning (columns, bucket count)|

### **Summary**

1. **Sampling**: Use when approximate results are acceptable, especially for metrics or exploratory analysis.
2. **Bucketing**: Use to optimize joins and queries on large datasets by dividing the data into smaller, manageable groups based on a key dimension.
