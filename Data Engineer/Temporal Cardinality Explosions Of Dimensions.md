- When you add a temporal aspect (timestamps, dates, or periods - year,quarter) to your dimensions(columns) and the cardinality(unique values) increases by at least 1 order of magnitude (at least 10X)
### **Why Does This Matter?**

1. **Increased Cardinality:**
    
    - The number of unique combinations grows exponentially as more granular temporal dimensions (e.g., hours, minutes) are added.
    - High cardinality impacts storage, query performance, and processing time.
2. **Impact on Data Systems:**
    
    - **Storage:** More rows require more disk space.
    - **Query performance:** Indexes and queries take longer to process with larger datasets.
    - **Processing time:** ETL pipelines and aggregations slow down

### **How to Handle This Growth**

1. **Data Aggregation:**
    
    - Aggregate data over larger temporal intervals (e.g., weekly or monthly instead of daily).
2. **Efficient Storage Formats:**
    
    - Use columnar storage formats like **Parquet** or **ORC**, which compress repeated values efficiently.
3. **Partitioning:**
    
    - Partition data by temporal dimensions (e.g., by year, month, or day) to limit the scope of queries.
4. **Indexing and Bucketing:**
    
    - Use indexing and bucketing strategies to improve query performance.
5. **Dimensional Reduction:**
    
    - Consider eliminating less critical dimensions or reducing temporal granularity when precise timestamps are unnecessary.
