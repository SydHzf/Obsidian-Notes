### **1. When Query Performance Is a Priority**

- **Reason**: Normalized fact tables require joins with multiple dimension tables to fetch related data, which can slow down queries, especially for large datasets.
- **When to Denormalize**:
    - Reports or dashboards require frequent aggregation and filtering across multiple dimensions.
    - Joins with dimension tables are a bottleneck in query performance.
- **Example**: Instead of joining a `fact_sales` table with a `product` dimension to get `product_name`, denormalize by including `product_name` directly in the fact table.

### **2. When You Have a Read-Heavy Workload**

- **Reason**: In analytics systems, most queries are read-heavy and need fast retrieval of aggregated data.
- **When to Denormalize**:
    - The fact table is primarily used for reporting and not frequently updated.
    - Query performance outweighs the need for normalized structures.
- **Example**: Store precomputed totals or derived metrics in the fact table to avoid computing them at query time.

### **3. When Using Star Schemas for Analytical Workloads**

- **Reason**: A star schema is a denormalized structure designed for analytical workloads to simplify queries and improve performance.
- **When to Denormalize**:
    - You’re building a data warehouse for BI tools.
    - Queries involve multiple joins with dimension tables, leading to slow response times.

### **4. When Data Volume is Too High for Joins**

- **Reason**: Large fact tables joined with large dimensions can result in expensive shuffle operations in distributed systems.
- **When to Denormalize**:
    - When processing high-volume datasets (e.g., logs, events, or transactions).
    - To avoid excessive resource usage for joins.
- **Example**: Include dimension attributes (like `region_name` from a `region` table) directly in the fact table.

### **5. When Dimensional Data is Relatively Static**

- **Reason**: Denormalizing works well if dimension data doesn’t change often because updates to denormalized tables can be complex and error-prone.
- **When to Denormalize**:
    - Dimension data like `country_name` or `product_category` rarely changes.
    - The maintenance overhead of denormalization is low.
