*Definition*:
	"OLAP stands for Online Analytical Processing. It is a type of system designed to handle complex queries and analyze large volumes of data from various sources. Unlike OLTP, which focuses on quick, simple transactions, OLAP is used for data analysis and decision-making. It helps users to quickly retrieve and analyze data from different perspectives, like looking at sales data over time, comparing performance across different regions, or analyzing trends and patterns. OLAP systems are optimized for reading and summarizing large datasets rather than making frequent updates. Examples of OLAP usage include business intelligence tools, data warehouses, and reporting systems."
