Introduction to Fact Data

- Fact data is the largest type of data in data engineering, exemplified by the two petabytes of data processed daily at Netflix.
- It encompasses every event a user can perform, leading to substantial data volume, especially for companies with billions of users like Facebook.
- The course will detail how to manage both small and large volumes of fact data, focusing on modeling fundamentals and practical applications.

Day One: Fact Data Modeling Fundamentals

- The first day covers the fundamentals of fact data modeling, including definitions and how to create effective models that integrate with dimensions.
- Practical lab sessions will involve building a fact data model using the MBA game details table in PostgreSQL.
- Setting up PostgreSQL is essential, with setup instructions provided in the course materials.

Understanding the Line Between Fact and Dimension

- Day two focuses on the blurred distinctions between fact and dimension, particularly how aggregating facts can resemble dimensions.
- The day will also introduce the dateless data structure used at Facebook to efficiently model user activity over time.
- Labs will involve creating the dateless data structure using advanced bit operations in PostgreSQL.

Day Three: Shuffle Minimization Techniques

- The third day dives into shuffle operations in Spark and Trino, emphasizing the importance of minimizing shuffle for performance optimization.
- A reduced fact framework will be introduced to help minimize the volume of fact data while retaining essential information.
- The lab will cover building a reduced fact framework to enhance analytical efficiency.

Challenges of Fact Data

- Facts are immutable records of events, providing a reliable historical account that cannot be altered, unlike dimensions which may change over time.
- The volume of fact data can be overwhelming, with a potential increase in cloud costs due to high data storage needs.
- Data engineers must ensure that fact data is modeled correctly to avoid issues related to duplicates, context, and analysis effectiveness.

Fact Data Modeling Techniques

- Fact data can be either normalized or denormalized, each with its benefits and challenges in terms of data integrity and redundancy.
- Normalized facts reduce duplicates and enhance data integrity but may complicate query performance, while denormalized facts can speed up queries but may lead to data redundancy.
- The choice of normalization versus denormalization should be guided by the scale and specific use case of the data being modeled.

Effective Logging Practices

- Effective logging is crucial for capturing accurate fact data, with proper schema definitions being essential for data integrity.
- Data engineers should collaborate with software engineers to ensure that logging practices yield high-quality data that is easy to analyze.
- Logging should be efficient to minimize costs, focusing on necessary data and avoiding excessive logging of unneeded information.

High Volume Fact Data Management

- High volume fact data requires careful management, including strategies like sampling and bucketing to reduce computational load without losing analytical value.
- Retention policies for fact data must be established to balance storage costs with the need for historical data, often leading to shorter retention periods for very large datasets.
- Data engineers must continuously evaluate the return on investment for data retention and adjust policies according to the evolving needs of the business.

The Nature of Fact and Dimension

- Facts represent quantifiable events that can be aggregated, while dimensions provide context and attributes related to those events.
- The relationship between facts and dimensions can be complex, with dimensions sometimes derived from fact data or vice versa.
- Understanding the distinction between facts and dimensions is critical for effective data modeling and analysis, particularly in large-scale data environments.

Conclusion and Next Steps

- The course emphasizes practical applications of fact data modeling, aiming to equip participants with skills to build efficient and effective data models.
- Participants are encouraged to engage with labs and exercises to reinforce their understanding of the concepts discussed.
- As the course progresses, more advanced topics will be introduced, building on the foundational knowledge established in the initial sessions.
